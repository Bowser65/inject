# Inject

You should place this file in the `Plugins` folder of the DiscordInjections project.

This plugin adds an api to inject your own code into discord's core functionality

## Coding style
This Plugin uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with [standardJS](https://standardjs.com/)

Visual Studio Code has an awesome [Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bysabi.prettier-vscode-standard) that executes those formatters on file save. As an alternative, you can run `prettier $file && standard $file`.
